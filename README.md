# Catter's Enchantment Tweaks
In 1.21, Mojang gave us datapack creators a lot more power with custom enchantments. I couldn't resist messing around with them! While many creators are likely going to make their own enchantment datapacks with tons of new stuff, I figured I would stick to the basics. This datapack only adjusts the Vanilla enchantments without adding any new ones. I also try to keep it somewhat in the Vanilla style, with the aim of rebalancing some enchantments or adding good quality of life features.

# Beta Notice
This datapack is in its early stages! I've undergone minimal testing, and only added a couple of tweaks so far. More to come later...

# Current Tweaks
### Smite
- Adds a little bit of normal Sharpness to non-undead mobs. At Smite V, this is equivalent to also having roughly Sharpness 2.
- When hitting baby zombies (and their variants), there is a chance to turn them into adults on hit, so it is easier to escape and hit them.
### Bane of Arthropods
- Adds a little bit of normal Sharpness to non-arthropod mobs. At Bane of Arthropods V, this is equivalent to also having roughly Sharpness 2.
### Loyalty
- When the trident hits the ground or a mob, it will fling all nearby items (within a block) back towards you. The higher the level, the stronger it will fling it! Use this as a way to quickly grab far away items, or to retrieve mob loot when kileld from afar.
### Horse and Wolf Armor
- Unfortunately it's not currently possible to allow wolf and horse armor to be placed in an enchantment table. However, they can now be enchanted in an anvil with the following enchanted books:
  - Depth Strider
  - Feather Falling
  - Frost Walker
  - Respiration
  - Thorns
  - Unbreaking (wolf armor only)
  - Mending (wolf armor only)

# Future Tweaks
Later down the line, here are a couple of things I want to look into:
- More trident enchantment buffs
- Maybe completely rework Mending?
- Mess with the Protections balancing
- ...and more!
